# Stray Detector
Project created for Hack(her)413 2022

Dataset used : https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/ 

This is a pet dataset by the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford. 

Main idea of this project is that :
1. This system will allow visually impaired or challenged people to detect any stray animals while walking on the walking tracks of the road.
2. This will also help self driving cars to detect any stray animals and thus save their lives

Algorithm used : Semantic Segmentation using FCN i.e MobileNet (Unet)
